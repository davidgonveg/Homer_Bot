# HomerBot - The Simpsons Bot

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a Jupyter notebook that utilizes a dataset containing dialogues from the TV show "The Simpsons." The primary goal is to build a chatbot inspired by the character Homer Simpson using the DialoGPT model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of dialogues from the TV series "The Simpsons." The dataset file is provided in the repository.

## Model
The chatbot is built upon the DialoGPT model, which is a language model developed by OpenAI. DialoGPT is trained to generate human-like responses in a conversational context.

## Jupyter Notebook
The main implementation and execution of the project are encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and chatbot implementation.

## Files
- `Homer_ChatBot_Small.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the project code, using DialoGPT Small.
- `Homer_ChatBot_Medium.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the project code, using DialoGPT Medium.
- `simpsons_dataset.csv`: Dataset file containing dialogues from "How I Met Your Mother."

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Homer_ChatBot_*.ipynb`) using a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and create the Homer Simpson chatbot.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially for a smooth execution.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter notebook environment

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the chatbot based on your preferences!

Happy chatting with HomerBot!
